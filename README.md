# 2021_PRMT7_regulates_Monocyte_Extravasation

Collaboration with the Conlon/Yildirim Group (Immunopathology of COPD) at the Institute of Lung Health and Immunity @Helmholtz Munich, for which Meshal Ansari and I performed the single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. I contributed the analysis of the mouse scRNA-seq data, including the processing, annotation, and cell fate prediction as shown in [Figure 1k-m](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28809-4#Fig1) and [Figure 5h and I](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28809-4#Fig5).
